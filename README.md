This study examines the mental health, empathy, and burnout among 886 medical students in 
Switzerland. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset capturing demographic, psychological, and academic 
factors, the research aims to identify predictors of mental health challenges, investigate the role of 
empathy in medical training, and explore the interplay of academic stress and personal attributes. The 
analysis includes descriptive and inferential statistics, correlational studies, and advanced regression 
techniques. Key findings are intended to inform policy recommendations for enhancing mental health 
support systems and fostering resilience in medical education. This work contributes to the broader 
societal goal of promoting the well-being of healthcare professionals and improving patient care 
outcomes.
